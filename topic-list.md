# Topic List
# COMP2000 Object-Oriented Programming Practices

Object-Oriented Programming Practices is a second-year computing unit which seeks to transition students from the first-year focus on a block-of-code-at-a-time to a whole-application-view.

The unit occupies a critical place in the Softare Technology, Web & Mobile, and Software Engineering programs of study.

Weekly classes Classes are organised around Team Based Learning. Students work in teams
on carefully calibrated activities which both re-inforce the fundamental concepts/skills
and allows them to creatively apply them as they choose. There will be thirteen 2-hour
collaborative classes accross semester at convenient times for students to choose from.

Students will form groups in the first week and work in those groups throughout all thirteen
classes.

Assignments The two assignments will revolve around creating an application that utilises various programming technologies covered in, but separately from the weekly classes.
